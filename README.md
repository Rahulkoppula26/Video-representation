Document describing the Bugs and Vulnerabilities
1)	The interface is very confusing, which makes the user/subscriber inconvenient and forces users to keep thinking about it, detracting from the attention they can devote to their task.
2)	The have some bugs which is making delay in loading the interface, even with fast network connection.
3)	The interface is continuously loading, when I open “Shared Wills” section.
4)	The “Start Creating” section on homepage, we have few options like “New Text Will”, “New Audio Will” and “New Video Will”. In these sections, I have personally encountered an issue that the input field (For) is not visible as a input text bar. It is just displayed as a simple text until user click the empty space next to “For” text. 
5)	In Asset vault while creating a Bank Account, there are no such suggestions while filling the Bank Name and IFSC Code. Here user have to fill the Bank Name and ISFC Code manually. If we create suggestions for Bank Name and IFSC Code, reduces manual work of filling the fields.
6)	In Asset vault, the heading is moving(issue in layout) from its position, while navigating from “My Assets” to “Label” and vise-a-versa.
